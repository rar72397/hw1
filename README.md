For the test file split_test.cpp, you have to provide an input 1-5 in order to run separate tests.
These determine what input will be used for the linked list.

1. Empty list
2. Negative numbers included
3. Evens only
4. Odds only
5. Normal list

There are no specific instructions for ulliststr_test.cpp

This is what that file tests:
1. pushing at the front and back on an empty list
2. pushing at the front and back if a node has a partially full array
3. pushing at the front and back when node's array is completely full
4. popping at the front and back of a partially full node
5. deallocating a node when an array has been emptied via popping front or back
